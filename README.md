# Road Network Project

This project is a simulation of a road network that calculates routes and manages vehicle traffic. It includes a set of React hooks for calculating routes and managing vehicle states, along with a testing suite to ensure functionality.

## Features

- Calculate the shortest route between two points in a road network.
- Manage vehicle traffic and congestion on roads.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-network.git
   cd road-network
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

**Start the development server:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash

   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default web browser.


## Running Tests

1. **Run the test suite:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn test:watch
   ```

   This will run the tests and watch for changes, re-running the tests automatically when files are updated.
